Read or initialize a number (n) that you want to check.
Declare two variables sum and product to store sum and product of digits. Initialize sum with 0 and product with 1.
Find the last digit (n%10) of the given number by using the modulo operator.
Add the last digit to the variable sum.
Multiply the last digit with the product variable.
Divide the given number (n) by 10. It removes the last digit.
Repeat steps 3 to 6 until the given number (n) becomes 0.
If the variable sum and product have the same value, then the given number (n) is a spy number, else not a spy number.
Let's implement the above step
